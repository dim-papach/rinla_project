# What is Git

Git is a tool used by developers to manage and track changes in their code. It helps teams collaborate on projects without overwriting each otherâ€™s work.

# How to use Git

To use code from a Git repository, you can follow these steps:

1. Clone the Git repository:
   Use the \`git clone\` command followed by the URL of the Git repository to clone it to your local machine. For example:
   
   ```shell
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```
   
   

2. Navigate to the cloned repository:
   Use the \`cd\` command to move into the directory of the cloned repository:
   
   ```shell
   cd <repository_name>
   ```

3. Check out a specific branch (if needed):
   If you want to work on a specific branch, use the \`git checkout\` command followed by the branch name:
   
   ```shell
   git checkout <branch_name>
   ```

4. Make changes or use the code:
   You can now make changes to the code or use it as needed. You can edit files, run scripts, or incorporate the code into your projects.

5. Pull the latest changes (if working collaboratively):
   If you are collaborating with others and want to get the latest changes from the remote repository, use the \`git pull\` command:
   
   ```shell
   git pull
   ```

6. Push your changes (if you have write access):
   If you have write access to the repository and want to push your changes back to the remote repository, use the \`git push\` command:
   
   ```shell
   git push
   ```
